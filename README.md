Presentation files and code from the January 2018 meeting on Image Processing by Larry O'Heron

## Description

Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data.

Prior to digital photography these things were controlled by the manipulation of film processing and film scanners. Tonal range and color were controlled in the lighting and also film processing but mostly through the deft control of lighting. In digital photography considerably more latitude is possible after image capture; that is in the processing stages. Areas too light can be darkened, areas too dark can be lightened, colors can be altered. Processes that used to take enormous amounts of time can now be achieved using just the computer. Photographers often make decisions in the capture stage about whether it is quicker and less expensive to fine tune a shot post photography (in the processing stage) instead of the lighting stage. Scientists strive to analyze areas of contrast that may be too small for the human eye to see.

In this presentation we will manipulate images thru a range of grey-scale contrasts, then apply color pallettes and wrap up with an analysis of how to center an object in a field-of-view.
